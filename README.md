# Horiseon Homework Refactor

This file was refactored to bring the code up to standard. Many changes were made to both the .HTML and the .CSS files.

Added semantic elements to the .HTML side and removed a few classes. Also added alt tags to images.

Changed some of the .CSS classes to mirror the semantic element and class changed on the .HTML. Consolidated classes where applicable and rearranged to fit the same logic structure as the .HTML.
